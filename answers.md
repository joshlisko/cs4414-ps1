Problem 1:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.57 Safari/537.36

	I am using Chrome so I can guess "Chrome/29.0.1547.57" is the current version of the browser. I can also guess that since I am using linux, "Linux i686" is the current operating system I am using. I do not have any idea why Mozilla and Safari are listed since I am not using either of those browsers. And I don't know what the AppleWebKit is for. Suffice to say I should do some googling.


Problem 2:
	I am not really sure why Rust does this but maybe the global static variables are able to be modified outside of the class and rust will not let you compile the code because it knows there is a chance the variable could be modified unintentionally.
